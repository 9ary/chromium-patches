# Streetwalrus's Chromium patches

Nothing too fancy here, feel free to use them for your own builds.


## Included patches

- `ddg.patch`: adds DuckDuckGo to the default search engines, useful
for Android builds since these do not allow adding custom search engines
from the preferences.
- `context-menu.patch`: extends the Android context menu to show title text,
src URL and href URL on everything based on what is set. You can finally browse
[xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/) and be able to see the hovertext. Also lets you
see what you would copy using the buttons.
